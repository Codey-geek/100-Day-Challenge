/* Taking user input for the number of rows to print- 
suppose user input for number of rows is 5 
therefore, 
r=5
=>k=5
taking outer for loop for the number of rows upto less than the number of rows since the iterating variable starts from 0, so to traverse till the number k=5, we are gping tp traverse it till one less than the number!
so outer for loop traverses from 0 to 4
inner for loop is for number of columns
=>for a=0
 b=10 and b>=0
so 11 spaces spaces will be printed 
then again initializing b to 0 and b<=0
printing stars for 1 time...the next time the condition will become false and star will not get printed.
Upto this, 1 row has completed!
Move to the next row using println statement!

=>for a=1
b=8 and b>=0
so 9 spaces spaces will be printed 
then again initializing b to 0 and b<=1
printing stars for 2 times...the next time the condition will become false and star will not get printed.
Upto this, 2 rows have completed!
Move to the next row using println statement!

=>for a=2
b=6 and b>=0
so 7 spaces spaces will be printed 
then again initializing b to 0 and b<=2
printing stars for 3 times...the next time the condition will become false and star will not get printed.
Upto this, 3 rows have completed!
Move to the next row using println statement!

=>for a=3
b=4 and b>=0
so 5 spaces spaces will be printed 
then again initializing b to 0 and b<=3
printing stars for 4 times...the next time the condition will become false and star will not get printed.
Upto this, 4 rows have completed!
Move to the next row using println statement!

=>for a=4
b=2 and b>=0
so 3 spaces spaces will be printed 
then again initializing b to 0 and b<=4
printing stars for 5 times...the next time the condition will become false and star will not get printed.
Upto this, 5 rows have completed!
Move to the next row using println statement!

=>for a=5
 the condition will become false andouter loop doesn't get executed.
